This is a GitHub repository where we can create a system to automatically download minutewise, 5-minutewise and hourly data of multiple stock tickers, indices, fx symbols, and crypto. It is entirely for educational purposes to understand web scraping and storing data.

Setup needed: Different folders for different indices each having 1m, 5m, and 1H folders each for respective time granularity data.

To download the latest data, run the file: download_stock_data.py after the setup is created as per indices and time granularity, or simply pull the project rather than creating all different files by yourself. To update once the data is pulled or downloaded run download_stock_data.py.
